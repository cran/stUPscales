Description: Integrated environmental modelling requires coupling sub-models at 
    different spatial and temporal scales, thus accounting for change of support 
    procedures (aggregation and disaggregation). We contribute to state-of-the-art 
    open source tools that support uncertainty propagation analysis in temporal and 
    spatio-temporal domains. We implement the tool for uncertainty propagation in 
    environmental modelling, with examples in the urban water domain. 
    The functionalities of the class setup and the methods and functions MC.setup, 
    MC.sim, MC.analysis and Agg.t are contained, which are used for setting up, 
    running and analysing Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation simulations, and for 
    spatio-temporal aggregation. We also implement functionalities to model and predict 
    variables that vary in space and time. stUPscales takes uncertainty characterisation 
    and propagation a step further by including temporal and spatio-temporal auto- and
    cross-correlation, resulting in more realistic (spatio-)temporal series of environmental 
    variables. Due to its modularity, the package allows the implementation of additional 
    methods and functions for spatio-temporal disaggregation of model inputs and outputs, 
    when linking models across multiple space-time scales.
